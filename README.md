Linux Configs

A collection of my various configuration files, for use in a debian environment (for now), as well as a python script to manage local syncing and publishing.


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of what should be kept where is confined to `config/configfiles.csv`.

One python script with two modes; see `python config_sync.py --help` for information.
